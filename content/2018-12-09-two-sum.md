### Question

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

<div class="question-content">
    <p></p><p>Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.</p>
    <p>The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.</p>
    <p>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.</p>
    <p style="font-family:monospace">
    <b>Input:</b> numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9<br>
    <b>Output:</b> index1=0, index2=1
    </p>
    <p></p>

### Stats

<table border="2">
    <tr>
        <td>Frequency</td>
        <td bgcolor="red">5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Diffficulty</td>
        <td bgcolor="lime">2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Adjusted Difficulty</td>
        <td bgcolor="yellow">3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Time to use</td>
        <td bgcolor="yellow">----------</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Ratings/Color = 1(white) 2(lime) 3(yellow) 4/5(red)

### Analysis

It's __not a good idea to sort the input__, because we are supposed to return the position index. Without sorting, we must use some data structure to help us!

And the answer is HashMap. 

### Solution

Read thru the list of integers, and each time add (targer - curInt) to the hashmap. 

If the number is contained in the HashMap, solution found. 

### My code 

    class Solution(object):
        def twoSum(self, nums, target):
             """
            :type nums: List[int]
            :type target: int
            :rtype: List[int]
            """
            lookup = {}
            for i, num in enumerate(nums):
                if target - num in lookup:
                    return [lookup[target - num], i]
                lookup[num] = i
